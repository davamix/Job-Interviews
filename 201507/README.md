### Overlapping cubes

Create an application that allow to the user set the dimensions and coords of two cubic objects in a tridimensional space and calculate if the objects are intersect and which is the volume of the shared space.

Is not a mathematician exercise, so to avoid to complicate the exercise we can consider that the two cubes are parallels, that is, there are not rotation from one in relation to the other.

The specified coords establish the center of the cube.
